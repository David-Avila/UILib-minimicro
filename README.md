This is a UI library I wrote for Mini Micro originally starting out as an easy way to add programmable buttons on screen.

### What all can I do with this?
Currently Labels, Textboxes, DraggableFrames, StaticFrames, Buttons are all functioning ui elements.
~Can also serve as a game engine but not really intended~

### Wheres the tutorial?
I don't think it's that tricky to grasp so i've left some demos that should get you started.
~Also im lazy~
